                <h3>What is the importance of photography in humanity?</h3>
                <p>
                    Photography is capable of recording a lot of information, and through this, it is possible for all these records to pass from generation to generation; that is the importance. You know those old photographs of your grandparents or when you were a kid? Those are records. It allows us the history, all that let, through photography.

                <h3>Why is it important to record the milestones of our life?</h3>
                <p>
                    Photography goes far beyond just recording an occasion. The Brazilian poet, translator, and journalist Mário Quintana “The photographer has the same mission as the poet: to immortalize the moment that passes.” is enlightening, as it defines the essence of all photography: transforming moments into eternal moments.

                    Why did you decide to photograph?

                    You know those moments when we're alone and we start to ramble on about life, photography, existence, the milky way, if tostines sells more because it's fresh or is it fresh because it sells more? So it is…

            <h3>Telling stories</h3>
            <p>
                Photography has its expected value when we talk about historical documentation, as it is able to immortalize moments in a concrete way. In this way, later generations can have knowledge and access to past events. Furthermore, images have become a visual collection of memories with priceless sentimental values. From an artist's point of view, photography reveals the world and life in a totally different dimension from what is in plain sight; it is capturing something that would not have been easily understood or noticed when that episode occurred.
