#H1 The big challenge

#H2 Background

Thinking about work and study background and I have all the skills to develop a website and after the classes of this term I have detailed knowledge of how to get answers to my doubts.

#H2 Challenges

The great challenge during this work was to organize the time and deal with adverse situations at the same time. This problem made me reflect on how to deal with day-to-day adversities and still handle all the activities of adult life.

#H2 Solutions 

Within the limitations presented I tried to seek the simple and functional. With the view that a project of this magnitude will not have an end defined by the delivery date of the assignment.

#H2 Resources

I used sources of previous works and also constant research to the material available in the course
